# InfluenSphere

InfluenSphere is an innovative platform designed to bridge the gap between sponsors and influencers, facilitating seamless collaboration for advertising campaigns. Built using Flask for the application code, Jinja2 templates combined with Bootstrap for HTML generation and styling, and SQLite for data storage, InfluenSphere ensures a robust and efficient user experience. The platform allows sponsors to create and manage multiple campaigns, search for suitable influencers, and send ad requests. Influencers, on the other hand, can browse public campaigns, negotiate terms, and accept or reject ad requests. This dynamic interaction not only helps sponsors get their products or services advertised effectively but also provides influencers with lucrative opportunities to monetize their social media presence.

The platform supports three distinct roles: Admin, Sponsor, and Influencer. Admins have root access, enabling them to monitor all users and campaigns, view statistics, and flag inappropriate content. Sponsors, whether companies or individuals, can create campaigns, track their progress, and manage their advertising budget. Influencers can update their profiles, showcasing their niche and reach, and engage with ad requests from sponsors. By leveraging these roles, InfluenSphere creates a comprehensive ecosystem where sponsors and influencers can connect, collaborate, and achieve their marketing goals efficiently. All functionalities are designed to be demonstrated on a local machine, ensuring ease of use and accessibility for all users.
